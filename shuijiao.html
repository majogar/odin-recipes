        <li>Wheat Flour</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Pork</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    
    <h5>Dough</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix wheat or rice flour, water, and a little salt.</li>
        <li>Start kneading and if it feels sticky, add some flour. </li>
        <li>After kneading, the dough should rest to develop gluten which will make it more elastic. </li>
        <li>Then, the dough is rolled into strips and cut into pieces which will each make an individual dumpling. Each piece should be rolled into a thin circle</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Filling</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Meat is often combined with ginger, mushrooms, garlic chives, scallions, Asian shallots, cucumber, etc.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>Shape the dumplings</h5>
    <ol>
        <li> Adjust the amount of filling to the size of the dough circle — 1 to 1 ½ tbsp should be enough. </li>
        <li>To seal the dumplings, moisten the wrapper edges with some water and fold them in half, pleating the edges, into a crescent shape.</li>
        <li>Keep the dough and the assembled dumplings under a wet cloth to prevent them from drying.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>The final stage</h5>
    <p>Dumplings are cooked in a large pot of boiling water which is sometimes slightly salted or oiled. </p>
    <p>Now you can enjoy a tasty Dumpling, I really hope it looks like the image</p>
